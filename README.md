## Sandbox Usage

You can define your own scenes in Blender, and then read them with Sketchbook. Sketchbook needs to run on a local server such as [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) or [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) to be able to load external assets.

<!-- #### Script tag -->

1. Import:

```html
<script src="sketchbook.min.js"></script>
```

2. Load a glb scene defined in Blender:

```javascript
const world = new Sketchbook.World('scene.glb');
```

<!--

#### NPM

1. Install:

```
npm i sketchbook
```

2. Import:

```javascript
import { World } from 'sketchbook';
```

3. Load a glb scene defined in Blender:

```javascript
const world = new World('scene.glb');
```
